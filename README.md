# VAE_for_Recommender_Systems_Collaborative_Filtering
This is the code for my thesis project code at QMUL.
- Before running the codes please make sure that you installed the correct version of libraries by using `library_versions.txt` file.
- `VAE_ML20M_hande_version.ipynb` contains the main code, while `calculate_sparsity.ipynb` contains dataset sparsity calculations.
- The train and validation results (.csv) are saved in ./results folder. 
- The test results can be found in "test_results" text file.
- Lastly, the training, validation, and test data after processing is in the ML-20M/pro_sg folder.
